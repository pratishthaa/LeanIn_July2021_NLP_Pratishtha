        "Problem Statement : Tweet Act Classification helps in comprehending the communicative intention of a tweeter. The main objective of this particular task is to identify speech acts in Twitter, i.e., tweet act classification. Given a tweet X, the task is to assign the most appropriate tweet act (say y2 among a set of tags (Y = {y1, y2, ... yi} where i is the number of tweet acts). Thus, it is a multi-class classification problem. Formally, it can be represented as y = argmax_{y'âˆˆ Y} F(y'|X) where F is the developed tweet act classifier."
